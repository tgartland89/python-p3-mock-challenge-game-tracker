# I start with where I have the least failing tests- here
# adding Result.all.append(self) clears this pytest 

# FAILED Result in result.py test Result class all attribute - assert 0 == 2

# I then set up Results like I did for the Orders class in the Coffee Challenge
# this class Result will look like the class Owner from Coffe Challenge where  Orders will now equal Results  
# I then changed what was passing through init to mirror the changes and get it to work- 
# customer is now player, coffee is now game, and price is now score
# adding the game.results, game.players, players.results, and players.games_played  will set me up so I can stat clearing the other pytes- 

# I moved on to game.py from here to start clearing those ones
